# Configuration files repository for Spark 2.0 Terasort benchmark

This repository hosts the configuration files for vanilla Apache Hadoop 2.7.2 and Apache Spark 2.0.0-preview that were used to perform the TeraSort bechmark. It was based on [Ewan Higgs] (https://github.com/ehiggs/spark-terasort) algorithm. The modified algorithm for Spark 2.0.0-preview is available [here](https://github.com/bigstepinc/spark-terasort).
